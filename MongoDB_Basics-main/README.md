# MongoDB_Basics

In this repository we will learn how to set up our database and start exploring different ways to search, create, and analyze our data with MongoDB. We will cover database performance basics, and discover how to get started with creating applications and visualizing our data.

We'll start together with the ultimate basics, learning what a database is and recognizing what makes MongoDB different in the database space. Then we'll move on to working with data as we grasp the difference between BSON and JSON and start to import, export and query. Next we'll absorb how to create and manipulate documents with hands-on learning, and skill-up to mastering advanced Create Read Update Delete (CRUD) operations. By this time we'll be ready to work on Indexing, Data Modeling, and creating an Aggregation Pipeline. Lastly we'll have the opportunity to explore the Atlas UI in more detail, investigate the Charts functionality and Realm, as well as explore the use of Compass.


In this repository we'll get our hands on all the basics, including querying, computing, connecting to, storing, indexing and analyzing our data.
